The Lethal Company Randomizer is a mod that I made after watching randomizer gameplay from other games like the Legend of Zelda or Kingdom Hearts. 

Though Lethal Company is essentially random; the levels themselves have set characteristics like scrap and enemy spawns(Ex. When you go to Embrion you expect 100 Old Birds to spawn). I decided that if a randomizer could be made; it would be by switching the possible scrap, inside enemies and outside enemies of each moon to any moon in the game. Example: If you go to Experimentation, you can get Titan scrap spawns, Gordion inside enemies and Adamance Outside Enemies. 

That's all to it for now! I do have more planned but time will tell when it comes out!
